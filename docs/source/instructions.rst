Register at Copernicus Climate Data Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You have to register at Copernicus Climate Data Service:
   `copernicus <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register?destination=%2F%23!%2Fhome>`__.
   After activating your account use your new account to log in. In you
   profile page you can find your user ID and your API key.

-  Copy your user ID and API key.

Create a key ascii file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In linux create a new file called .cdsapirc in the home directory of your user and add
the following two lines:

::

   url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2

   key: UID:KEY 

Replace UID with your user ID and KEY with your API key

Info on available variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   era5cli info <name>

Show information on available variables and levels.

positional arguments:
 --name       Enter list name to print info list:

              :samp:`levels` for all available pressure levels 

              :samp:`2dvars` for all available single level or 2D
              variables

              :samp:`3dvars` for all available 3D variables 

              Enter variable name (e.g. "total_precipitation")
              or pressure level (e.g. "825") to show if the
              variable or level is available and in which list.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit


Running era5cli from the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
era5cli can be used to fetch both hourly data and monthly averaged data.


Fetching hourly data
====================

Fetch hourly data through an cdsapi call via command line. More information on the available data and options can be found on:

| `Era5 hourly single levels download page <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview>`_.
| `Era5 hourly pressure levels download page <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview>`_.

Execute the data fetch process for hourly data:

::

   era5cli hourly --variables <variables> --startyear <startyear> --endyear <endyear> --months <months> --days <days> --hours <hours> --levels <levels> --outputprefix <outputprefix> --format <fileformat> --split <split> --threads <threads> --ensemble <ensemble> --statistics <statistics>

optional arguments:

  --variables VARIABLES

                        The variables to be downloaded, can be a single
                        or multiple variables. See the cds
                        website or run :samp:`era5cli info -h` for available variables.

                        data should be downloaded.
                        Every year will be downloaded in a separate file
                        by default. Set :samp:`--split false` to change this.
